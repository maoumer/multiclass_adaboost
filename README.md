# multiclass_adaboost
Implementation of multiclass AdaBoost classifier on brain tumor MRI images obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset).

The implementation is based on the SAMME algorithm from the paper [Multi-class AdaBoost](https://hastie.su.domains/Papers/samme.pdf).
